Evaluation Criteria

We are interested in how you solve the solution, prioritize the feature set, and how you use Rails/React/GraphQL together. You may use other libraries, although that is not required. We understand that not everyone is familiar with these technologies so in these cases, weâ€™re interested to see your process in learning new things.

We will assess how you balance technical trade offs and code quality. During our video call, you will brief us on your approach to the project, and walk through your solution.
